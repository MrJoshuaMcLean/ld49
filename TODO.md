# To Do

## Game

- start with some amount of money (difficulty levels: $X, hardest is loans, like SimCity2000)
- handle negative money (game over?)
- repay by set amount
- manually handle minimum payments (can overpay)
- set auto advance speed (scrollbar? or +/-)
- various data: profit per quarter (per company and total), employees sorted by salary/happiness, "score" calculated by # companies, employees, personal money

## Company

- handle negative money (can't pay employees, they quit? bankruptcy)
- manually liquidate company (sell all "work" at lesser amount)
- determine self salary per company, place in game money
- decide how much capital to put into company (autoloan if not enough?) 
- set salary on hire
- severance package on fire
- get money from amount of work (sell at threshold, money to company)
- promotion and in-company work levels
- transfer money to and from companies

## Person

- handle negative money (death?)
- whole happiness/personality/specialization system
- person spending money (livelihood) and track savings/liquid to affect happiness
- random death chance (accidents, health, etc.)
- track experience (increases effectiveness)
- age people and retirement

## Wishlist

- get a job for more income (instead of starting with money)
